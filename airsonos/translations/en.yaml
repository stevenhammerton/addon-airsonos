configuration:
  log_level:
    name: Log level
    description: >-
      Controls the level of log details the add-on provides.
  port:
    name: Port
    description: >-
      The port to run on, the default of 49152 should be good for most cases.
  address:
    name: Address
    description: >-
      Allows you to specify the IP address the AirCast server needs to
      bind to.
  latency_rtp:
    name: RTP Latency
    description: >-
      Allows you to tweak the buffering, which is needed when the audio is
      stuttering (e.g., low-quality network). This option specifies the number
      of ms the add-on has to buffer the RTP audio (AirPlay). Setting this value
      below 500ms is not recommended! Setting the value to 0 makes the add-on
      to get the value from AirPlay.
  latency_http:
    name: HTTP Latency
    description: >-
      Allows you to tweak the buffering, which is needed when the audio is
      stuttering (e.g., low-quality network). This option specifies the number
      of ms the add-on has to buffer the HTTP audio.
  drift:
    name: Drift
    description: >-
      Allow to let timing reference drift (no click).
  http_length:
    name: HTTP Length
    description: >-
      The default mode of AirUPnP is "no content-length" (\<http_length\> = -1) but
      unfortunately, some players can't deal with that. You can then try
      "chunked-encoding" (\<http_length> = -3) but some players who claim to be HTTP
      1.1 do not support it. There is a last resort option to add a large fake
      `content-length` (\<http_length\> = 0). It is set to 2^31-1, so around 5 hours
      of playback with flac re-encoding. Note that if player is HTTP 1.0 and
      http_header is set to -3, AirUPnP will fallback no content-length. The command
      line option `-g` has the same effect that \<http_length\> in the \<common\>
      section of a config file.
